### Problem 1 (10 Points)

For the plane stress $\sigma_x = -8MPa$, $\sigma_y = 7MPa$, $\tau_{xy} = 6MPa$ cw, 
draw a Mohr's circle diagram properly labeled,
   find the principal normal and shear stresses, and determine the angle from the 
   $x$ axis to $\sigma_1$. 
   Draw stress elements as in Fig. 3-11c and d (Shigley's) and label all details.


### Problem 2 (30 Points)

A countershaft carrying two V-belt pulleys is shown in the figure. Pulley A receives power from a
   motor through a belt with the belt tensions shown. The power is transmitted through the shaft and
   delivered to the belt on pulley B. Assume the belt tension on the loose side at B is 15 percent of
   the tension on the tight side.
   
   * Determine the tensions in the belt on pulley B, assuming the shaft is running at a constant
   speed.
   
   * Find the magnitudes of the bearing reaction forces, assuming the bearings act as simple
   supports.
   
   * Draw shear-force and bending-moment diagrams for the shaft. If needed, make one set for the
   horizontal plane and another set for the vertical plane.
   
   * At the point of maximum bending moment, determine the bending stress and the torsional
   shear stress.
   
   * At the point of maximum bending moment, determine the principal stresses and the maximum
   shear stress.

### Problem 3 (20 Points)

The cantilevered bar in the figure is made from a ductile material and is statically loaded with
  $F_y = 200lbf$ and 
  $F_x = F_z = 0$. Analyze the stress situation in rod AB by obtaining the following
   information.
   
   * Determine the precise location of the critical stress element.
   
   * Sketch the critical stress element and determine magnitudes and directions for all stresses acting
   on it. (Transverse shear may only be neglected if you can justify this decision.)
   
   * For the critical stress element, determine the principal stresses and the maximum shear stress.

### Problem 4 (20 Points for Part 1 and 2)

Consider a cantilever beam as shown in the figure with length 
$l$ and the left end fixed to a wall.

1. Derive the deflection $y$  of the beam along 
$x$ under a single downward force $F$ on the right,
and assume that the moment of inertia $I$  is constant along 
$x$. 
(Show complete derivation instead of the final function 
$y(x)$) 

2. Now consider that the beam has two connected parts, with the part on the left (of length 
$l/2$) having a moment of 
inertia 
$I_1$, 
and the part on the right 
$I_2$. 
Derive the deflection $y$ again.
 Ignore stress concentration.

3. Further, consider that the cross-sections for the two parts are both circular, and the total volume
of the beam is constant. What should 
$I_1$ and 
$I_2$ be for the beam to have minimal maximum deflection? (Optional)
