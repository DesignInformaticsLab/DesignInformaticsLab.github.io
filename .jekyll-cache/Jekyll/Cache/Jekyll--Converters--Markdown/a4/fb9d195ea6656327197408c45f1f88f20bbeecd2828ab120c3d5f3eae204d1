<h3 id="problem-1-10-points">Problem 1 (10 Points)</h3>

<p>For the plane stress <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_x" /> = -8MPa, 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_y" /> = 7MPa, 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\tau_{xy}" /> = 6MPa cw, 
    draw a Mohr’s circle diagram properly labeled,
   find the principal normal and shear stresses, and determine the angle from the 
   <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x" /> axis to 
   <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_1" />. 
   Draw stress elements as in Fig. 3-11c and d (Shigley’s) and label all details.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2-30-points">Problem 2 (30 Points)</h3>

<p>A countershaft carrying two V-belt pulleys is shown in the figure. Pulley A receives power from a
   motor through a belt with the belt tensions shown. The power is transmitted through the shaft and
   delivered to the belt on pulley B. Assume the belt tension on the loose side at B is 15 percent of
   the tension on the tight side.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Determine the tensions in the belt on pulley B, assuming the shaft is running at a constant
   speed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find the magnitudes of the bearing reaction forces, assuming the bearings act as simple
   supports.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw shear-force and bending-moment diagrams for the shaft. If needed, make one set for the
   horizontal plane and another set for the vertical plane.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the point of maximum bending moment, determine the bending stress and the torsional
   shear stress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the point of maximum bending moment, determine the principal stresses and the maximum
   shear stress.</p>
  </li>

<p>The cantilevered bar in the figure is made from a ductile material and is statically loaded with
   <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F_y = 200" /> lbf and 
   <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F_x = F_z = 0" />. Analyze the stress situation in rod AB by obtaining the following
   information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Determine the precise location of the critical stress element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sketch the critical stress element and determine magnitudes and directions for all stresses acting
   on it. (Transverse shear may only be neglected if you can justify this decision.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the critical stress element, determine the principal stresses and the maximum shear stress.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-4-20-points-for-part-1-and-2">Problem 4 (20 Points for Part 1 and 2)</h3>

<p>Consider a cantilever beam as shown in the figure with length 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l" /> and the left end fixed to a wall.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Derive the deflection <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y" />  of the beam along 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x" /> under a single downward force 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F" /> on the right,
and assume that the moment of inertia <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I" />  is constant along 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x" /> . 
(Show complete derivation instead of the final function 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y(x)" />)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now consider that the beam has two connected parts, with the part on the left (of length 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l/2" />) having a moment of 
inertia 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_1" />, 
and the part on the right 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_2" />. 
Derive the deflection <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y" /> again.
 Ignore stress concentration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, consider that the cross-sections for the two parts are both circular, and the total volume
of the beam is constant. What should 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_1" /> and 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_2" /> be for the beam to have minimal maximum deflection? (Optional)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="problem-5-20-points">Problem 5 (20 Points)</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Form your project phase 1 team</em>. Choose one of the three components: (1) Shaft, (2) Gear, (3) Bearing and key. 
A shaft team should have 5-6 people; a gear team 3 people; and a bearing and key team 2 people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Formulate a pseudo code (flow chart) for component-wise analysis and design</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For shaft teams, please read Chapter 6 on Fatigue Failure Resulting from Variable Loading and 
Chapter 7 on Shafts and Shaft Components (Sections 7-4 to 7-5). Start with Example 7-2 that runs through the whole design process, 
list down the concepts you do not understand, and then seek answers to these questions from Chapters 6 and 7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For gear teams, please read Chapter 13 Gears-General Sections 13-1 to 13-8 and 13-13 and 
Chapter 14 Spur and Helical Gears. For Chapter 14, start with Section 14-19 and the example within, list down 
the concepts you do not understand, and then seek answers from the chapter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For bearing and key teams, please read Chapter 11 on Rolling-Contact Bearings and Chapter 7 Section 7-7.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pseudo code should specify (1) the inputs, e.g., 
static and dynamic loading conditions, geometry, target safety factors, (2) the outputs, e.g., 
detailed component geometry design, material selection, performance metrics, and (3) the design flow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a starting point, your submission does not have to be perfect but needs to show your best effort.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
