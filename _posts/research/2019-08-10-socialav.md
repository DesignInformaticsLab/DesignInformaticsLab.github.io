abstract: "This project will promote the progress of science, and advance the
           national prosperity and safety, by tackling an important and challenging
           problem for autonomous vehicles (AVs): interaction of AVs with
           human-driven vehicles. Currently, there is a lack of theory that
           allows an autonomous vehicle to interact with multiple surrounding
           vehicles in a safe and socially-adept manner. This National Robotics
           Initiative (NRI) project will address this critical need by developing
           a novel algorithm framework for an autonomous vehicle to be able to
           anticipate other vehiclesâ€™ behavior and customize its motion according
           to the local driving culture. This project serves the national
           interests by advancing knowledge in the fields of control
           engineering, machine learning, and cognitive science.  The project
           will also make an important step in making widely adopted autonomous
           vehicles a reality, which promises to increase transportation system
           efficiency and safety."
