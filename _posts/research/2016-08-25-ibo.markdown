abstract: "Solving optimal design problems through crowdsourcing faces a dilemma: 
On one hand, human beings have been shown to be more effective than algorithms at searching 
for good solutions of certain real-world problems with high-dimensional or discrete solution 
spaces; on the other hand, the cost of setting up crowdsourcing environments, the uncertainty 
in the crowd's domain-specific competence, and the lack of commitment of the crowd, all contribute 
to the lack of real-world application of design crowdsourcing. We are thus motivated to 
investigate a solution-searching mechanism where the computer learns to mimic the search 
strategy of a human solver, so that the search can be continued after he/she abandons the 
problem."
