abstract: "Governments encourage use of electric vehicles (EV) via regulation and investment to
           minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Manufacturers produce vehicles to maximize
           profit, given available public infrastructure and government incentives. EV public adoption
           depends not only on price and vehicle attributes, but also on EV market size and
           infrastructure available for refueling, such as charging station proximity and recharging
           length and cost. Earlier studies have shown that government investment can create EV
           market growth, and that manufacturers and charging station operators must cooperate
           to achieve overall profitability. This article describes a framework that connects decisions
           by the three stakeholders (government, EV manufacturer, charging station operator) with
           preferences of the driving public."
