abstract: "Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) aims to accelerate 
optimal design of complex material systems by integrating material science and 
design automation. For tractable ICME, it is required that (1) a structural feature 
space be identified to allow reconstruction of new designs, and (2) the 
reconstruction process be property-preserving. The majority of existing 
structural presentation schemes rely on the designer's understanding of specific 
material systems to identify geometric and statistical features, which could be 
biased and insufficient for reconstructing physically meaningful microstructures 
of complex material systems. This project aims at developing feature learning mechanisms 
to automate a two-way conversion between microstructures and their 
lower-dimensional feature representations.
Our method achieved a 1000-fold dimension reduction from the microstructure 
space on a variety of heterogeneous material systems with distinct microstructural 
features. Current study focuses on improving the mechanism by developing physics-based
network architectures, e.g., for n-point correlation functions, and incorporating
them into the feature learning process. We hypothesize that such models will further
improve the validity of the learned features."
