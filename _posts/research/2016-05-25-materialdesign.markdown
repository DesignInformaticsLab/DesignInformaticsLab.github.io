abstract: "Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) aims to 
develop scalable design methodologies for complex material systems by leveraging and extending 
knowledge from material science and design automation. The key challenges are 
(1) the high dimensional design representations of material structures and (2) 
the high computational cost for physics-based process-structure-property mappings.
For (1), we develop unsupervised learning models that learn lower-dimensional feature 
spaces from where new designs (microstructures and topologies) can be created 
based on samples;
for (2), we integrate deep learning and physics-based models to discover key factors 
(e.g., microstructure patterns) that influence properties of interest (e.g., fracture strength)."
