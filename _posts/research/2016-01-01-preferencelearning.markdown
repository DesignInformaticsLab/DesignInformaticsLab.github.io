                between variables and a preference model (b) Optimal vehicle distribution visualization. Every point represents
                                                             the optimal vehicle for one consumer. In the left column, the
                                                             optimal vehicle is inferred using the utility model with original variables.

abstract: "Quantitative preference models are used to predict customer
           choices among design alternatives by collecting prior purchase
           data or survey answers. This paper examines how to
           improve the prediction accuracy of such models without collecting
           more data or changing the model. We propose to use
           features as an intermediary between the original customer linked
           design variables and the preference model, transforming
           the original variables into a feature representation that
           captures the underlying design preference task more effectively.
           We apply this idea to automobile purchase decisions
           using three feature learning methods (principal component
           analysis, low rank and sparse matrix decomposition, and exponential
           sparse restricted Boltzmann machine), and show
           that the use of features offers improvement in prediction accuracy
           using over 1 million real passenger vehicle purchase
           data. We then show that the interpretation and visualization
           of these feature representations may be used to help augment
           data-driven design decisions."
