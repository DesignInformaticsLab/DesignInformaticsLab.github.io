abstract: "In this ongoing project, we investigate model architectures and learning procedures that
enable generation of novel 3D shapes based on unseen combinations of functional labels of objects. 
To do so, we look for robust classifiers enabled by iteratively learning through crowdsourcing mechanisms. 
In an existing work, we acquire 3D shape saliency knowledge using a crowdsourcing game, inspired by 
von Ahn's Peekaboom game."
