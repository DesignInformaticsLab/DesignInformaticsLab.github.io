abstract: "We developed this game to analyze how human players solve
the optimal design and control problem embedded in a racer game: The player needs to finish
the track within 36 seconds with as little energy consumption as possible. We then compare human results
with the Efficient Global Optimization (Bayesian Optimization) algorithm. Results showed that some human
beings are efficient at finding good solutions, yet most of them cannot get close to the true optimal solution."
