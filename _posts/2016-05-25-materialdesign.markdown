abstract: "Computational material design (CMD) aims to accelerate optimal design of complex material
systems by integrating material science and design automation. For tractable CMD, it is required that
(1) a feature space be identified to allow reconstruction of new designs, and (2) the reconstruction
process be property-preserving. Existing solutions rely on the designer's understanding of specific
material systems to identify geometric and statistical features, which could be insufficient for
reconstructing physically meaningful microstructures of complex material systems. Our current work
investigates learning mechanisms that could automate the conversion between microstructures and their
lower-dimensional feature representations."
