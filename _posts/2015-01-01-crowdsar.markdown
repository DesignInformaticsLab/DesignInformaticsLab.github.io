abstract: "Teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been suggested as sensor platforms
           for disaster victim search systems used shortly after natural disasters such as an earthquake
           or tsunami. Previous efforts have used UAVs equipped with video cameras for the disaster
           information gathering stage, with the information processing stage performed by either
            a single human operator or a victim detection computer vision algorithm.  We propose
             extending these efforts by investigating how a large and distributed 'crowd'
             of search volunteers and professionals may augment the information processing stage
             by helping search video feeds for disaster victims.  An experiment is conducted comparing
             the victim detection accuracy between a single human searcher, a crowd of searchers, and
             a victim detection algorithm.  Our preliminary results show that while victim search
             accuracy is sensitive to a system design variable, namely, UAV altitude, crowdsourcing
              the search process can be more accurate than a single human or victim detection
              algorithm alone.  These findings are a first step towards optimizing search system
               design with respect to both information collection and information processing augmented
               with crowdsourcing."
