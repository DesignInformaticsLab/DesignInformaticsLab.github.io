### Title: [Decentralized Attribution and Secure Training of Generative Models](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2101052&HistoricalAwards=false)


### Abstract:
Generative models describe real-world data distributions such as images, texts, and human motions, and are playing an essential role in a large and growing range of applications from photo editing to natural language processing to autonomous driving. There are two open challenges regarding the development and dissemination of generative models: (1) Adversarial applications of generative models have created concerning socio-technical disturbances (e.g., espionage operations and malicious impersonation); and (2) developing generative models using multiple proprietary datasets (which are needed to reduce data biases) raises privacy concerns about data leakage. Legislative efforts have recently been taken in the wake of these challenges, so far with limited consensus on the format of regulations and knowledge about their technological or social feasibility. To this end, this project will develop new mathematical theories and computational tools to assess the feasibility of two connected solutions to these challenges: Model attribution enforces the owners to be correctly identified based on their generated contents; secure training ensures zero data leakage during the collaborative training of attributable generative models. If successful, the outcomes of the project will provide technical guidance for future regulation design towards secure development and dissemination of generative models. Project results will be disseminated through a project website, open-source software, and public datasets. The impacts of the project will be broadened through educational activities, including new course modules on Artificial Intelligence (AI) security, undergraduate research projects, and outreach to the local community through lab tours, to prepare underrepresented groups with skills to mitigate risks from malicious impersonation and biased data/model representations targeting these groups.
