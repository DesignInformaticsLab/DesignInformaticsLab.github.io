### Title: Efficient Reconstruction and Optimal Design of Multi-scale Material Systems through Deep Networks

### Abstract: 
Computational material design (CMD), such as identifying optimal material 
microstructures to achieve desirable performance, receives a growing interest 
as sophisticated material designs can be subsequently realized using advanced 
\processing techniques such as additive manufacturing. Conceptually, solving CMD 
problems involves iterative search for the best solutions in a problem space. Since 
the cost of solution searching is sensitive to the size of the space, the lack of 
cost-efficiency hampers the application of existing CMD approaches to complex 
material systems, where the goodness of the material design depends on numerous 
details of the microstructure on multiple length scales. This award supports 
fundamental research to develop  scalable computational design tools to enable 
tractable CMD, by discovering the critical microstructure patterns and thus reducing 
the dimensionality of the problem space. The research will lead to efficient 
microstructure design and validation for high performance structural materials with 
superior durability and structural health. Therefore, results from this research 
will benefit various U.S. industries, and its economy and society. The required 
seamless integration of material science, engineering design, manufacturing, and 
data science will help to broaden student participation and positively impact 
engineering education.

Two core technical enablers for tractable CMD will be developed. These include 
(1) a generative statistical model that learns important local microstructure 
patterns at multiple length scales, and provides a two-way detail-preserving 
conversion between microstructures and their low-dimensional design representations; 
and (2) a cost-effective modeling framework for processing-structure-property mapping 
using physics-based simulations and active learning, to facilitate effective 
processing- and microstructure-level solution space exploration and optimal design. 
Key challenges will be addressed to enable scalable microstructure feature learning 
by taking into account the physical interpretability of the learned features. Novel 
deep network architectures and learning techniques will be investigated to this end. 
The statistical modeling of the processing-structure mapping will be achieved by a 
physics-based simulation tool where both phase morphology and crystallographic 
information are explicitly considered; the modeling of the structure-property mapping 
is achieved by a novel lattice-particle simulation method.
