**Title: Decentralized Attribution of Generative Models**

<b>Abstract</b>: Growing applications of generative models have led to new threats such as malicious personation and digital copyright infringement. One solution to these threats
                 is model attribution, i.e., the identification of user-end models where the contents
                 under question are generated from. Existing studies showed empirical feasibility
                 of attribution through a centralized classifier trained on all user-end models. However, this approach is not scalable in reality as the number of models ever grows.
                 Neither does it provide an attributability guarantee. To this end, this paper studies
                 decentralized attribution, which relies on binary classifiers associated with each
                 user-end model. Each binary classifier is parameterized by a user-specific key and
                 distinguishes its associated model distribution from the authentic data distribution.
                 We develop sufficient conditions of the keys that guarantee an attributability lower
                 bound. Our method is validated on MNIST, CelebA, and FFHQ datasets. We also
                 examine the trade-off between generation quality and robustness of attribution
                 against adversarial post-processes.
