### Title: AI Institute: Planning: Novel Neural Architectures for 4D Materials Science

### Abstract:
High-fidelity predictive modeling of complex materials under extreme conditions (high temperature, high stress, corrosive environment etc.) is crucial for accelerating material design and optimization to address the pressing challenges in our world. This project will aim to leverage both fundamental and use-inspired artificial intelligence (AI) research, coupled with cutting-edge experiments, to revolutionize and transform traditional materials science and engineering (MSE). The novel approach, rooted in the fundamental principle in MSE, that microstructure controls properties, focuses on the development of novel neural architectures that naturally capture the physical causal relations across key microstructural features at multiple length and time scales for predictive modeling and optimal material design. The methodologies and experimental frameworks for constructing novel physics-based learning models developed in this project will be applied to a variety of compelling problems in complex material systems including ceramics, metals and metallic alloys, composites, and porous materials. It is expected that this project will impact many areas including aerospace, microelectronics, petroleum industry, and consumer products.
