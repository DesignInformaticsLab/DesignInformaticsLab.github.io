## Potential Project Topics

The following are potential topics that you can pick or develop from. The percentage in the bracket
indicates the highest score you can get by picking the topic. I will keep adding ideas to this list.

### Autonomous driving

1. Share ride (100%): Consider a city as a graph with finite number of nodes and edges. Each request is represented by
two different nodes for which a path between the two exists, one for pickup and the other for destination. 
Let a finite number of cars be at a subset of nodes. What is the best routing strategy to minimize the overall 
 distance to cover by these cars while meeting all requests?
 
2. Race track optimization (100%): Please see this previous 
[project report](http://designinformaticslab.github.io/_teaching//designopt/projects/2015/desopt_2015_03.pdf), and
propose to improve (1) the modeling, (2) the problem formulation, (3) or the optimization algorithm based on 
the report.

3. Energy-efficient powertrain control through traffic jams (100%): Design a hybrid powertrain and 
its control strategy to improve the energy efficiency for heavy trucks in traffic jams. See previous
project reports for models of hybrid powertrain.

### Optimal planning and control

1. Propose a different control problem than the pole balancing demo and solve it by designing a model-based or 
model-free optimal control algorithm. You score will be based on the number of system states and 
the size of action space. (100%)

2. Adversarial attack on sensors (100%): Based on the pole balancing controller we developed in the class, 
design an attacking mechanism, that deteriorates the performance of the controller by disturbing 
the observation of the system states. Then design a defence mechanism for the attack.

3. Desert on Mars (100%): Consider that you need to build a road on Mars from point A to B. At the moment, 
you only have a base at A with an energy recharge station. To build the road, you will need to run a vehicle from
 A to B, and back to A. The destination B will take T days to reach from A, while the vehicle has a range of T/2. 
 Therefore, it will be necessary to set up intermediate recharging stations along the road. For example, the 
 vehicle can run for a distance of T/3 (we are equating time to distance by assuming constant speed), store T/3 
 at that location, and return back to A for a full recharge. Question: What is the minimal total energy expense?
 
 
### Mechanical design

1. Bridge design (100%): Design a bridge (in 2D or 3D) that holds a certain load, and meets certain constraints on
its overall length and weight. 

2. Origami structure design (100%, collaboration with Dr. Hanqing Jiang): The origami structure
is the following. The design goal is to fine-tune the geometry to achieve optimal stiffness when 
deployed. Models are available. May need to use ANSYS for optimization.
