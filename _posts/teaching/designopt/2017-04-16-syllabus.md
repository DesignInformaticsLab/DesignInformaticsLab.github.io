## MAE 598/494 Design Optimization | Fall 2018

**Faculty**: Max Yi Ren 

**Email**: yiren@asu.edu 

**Office**: GWC464

**Location & Time**: ECGG347, TU/TH 4:30pm-5:45pm

**Office hours**: TU/TH 2:00pm-4:00pm in GWC464, or by appointment

**Prerequisites**:  No previous knowledge about optimization is expected or required. 
However, solid background in calculus and linear algebra is assumed ([Math review](http://designinformaticslab.github.io/designopt_tutorial/2017/08/15/mathreview.html)).
Students are also expected to have basic programming skills (Matlab and Python preferred).

### Course Overview

The purpose of this course is to introduce the student to mathematical modeling, 
optimization theory, and computational methods for analytical and simulation-based 
optimal system design. The student will learn to (i) develop proper mathematical 
models to formulate design optimization problems and (ii) develop and apply appropriate 
optimization algorithms to solve them.

### Workload and grading

There are 5 homework assignments, 
2 mid-term exams, and a team project.

* Homework (6%*5)
* Exams (15%*2)
* Project review 1 (10%)
* Project review 2 (**20%**)
* Project final report (10%)

### Project

1. Each team should have no more than 3 students.

2. Students are responsible for defining a design problem and
proposing a credible plan to solve it.
Past project reports can be found from the
[course website](http://designinformaticslab.github.io/_pages/teaching/opt_index.html).
Tentative topics can be found [here](http://designinformaticslab.github.io/designopt_tutorial/2017/10/14/designopt-project.html).

3. Preliminary report is due on **Oct 4**. The report should contain a mathematical description
of the optimization problem to be solved, and all validated models needed for solving this problem.
Key challenges and mitigation strategies should be identified.
See detailed requirements [here](http://designinformaticslab.github.io/designopt_tutorial/2018/08/14/designopt-preliminaryguideline.html).

4. Progress report is due on **Nov 13**. The report should contain a complete analysis
on the solutions to the target problem. Parametric studies should be included.
See detailed requirements [here]().

5. Each student will be graded by their own contributions to the project.

### Academic Integrity

Each student has an obligation to act with honesty and integrity, and to respect the rights of others in carrying out all academic assignments.
MAE 598/494 will follow the process defined by the Office of
the Dean of Students, which states that any student who is found to
have violated the Student Code of Conduct will, at a minimum,
receive an E in the course. The College Policy defines the process to
be used if the student wishes to appeal this action.
