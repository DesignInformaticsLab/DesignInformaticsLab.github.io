## MAE 540 Advanced Product Design | Spring 2017 

**Faculty**: Max Yi Ren 

**Email**: yiren@asu.edu 

**Office**: GWC464

**Location & Time**: TBD, TU/TH 4:30pm-5:45pm

**Office hours**: TU/TH 2:00pm-4:00pm in GWC464, or by appointment

**Prerequisites**:  No previous knowledge about optimization is expected or required. 
However, solid background in calculus and linear algebra is assumed. 
Students are also expected to have basic programming skills (Matlab and Python preferred).

***

### Course Overview

The purpose of this course is to introduce the student to mathematical modeling, 
optimization theory, and computational methods for analytical and simulation-based 
optimal system design. The student will learn to (i) develop proper mathematical 
models to formulate design optimization problems and (ii) develop and apply appropriate 
optimization algorithms to solve them.

***

### Workload and grading

This class will be **time-consuming**. There are 5 homework assignments, 
2 mid-term exams, and an individual project report. 

* Homework (8%*5)
* Project report (30%)
* Exams (15%*2)

### Academic Integrity

Each student has an obligation to act with honesty and integrity, and to respect the rights of others in carrying out all academic assignments. MAE 540 will follow the process defined by the Office of the Dean of Students, which states that any student who is found to have violated the Student Code of Conduct will, at a minimum, receive an E in the course. The College Policy defines the process to be used if the student wishes to appeal this action.
