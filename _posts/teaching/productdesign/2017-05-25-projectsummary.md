### Team 1: **Anti-theft bicycle alarm** 

Bicycle theft is a common problem with an estimated loss of $100 million in the United States. 
Current solutions either rely only on mechanical locking features, or have a price that exceeds 
the average person's budget. Our solution utilizes IoT technology in an affordable
package targeting medium-end and high-end bike users. | [**business plan**][1]

### Team 2: **Retractable headphone case**

### Team 4: **Personalized Broadcast**
 
The motivation of this project is to rectify the audibility problems in Classrooms 
and Conference Halls by using a Sound Control system which will ensure that every 
person/Student in classroom will hear properly to what Professor/Lecturer is saying. 
In this system, we will transmit Professor's voice on a particular FM frequency using 
FM Transmitters. Students can listen to Professor using his Smartphone or any kind of 
FM Receiver. Furthermore, this system can also be used in Museums, Art galleries,
 Airport Terminals etc. to guide visitors/Travelers by transmitting crucial data about 
 that place on a particular FM Frequency. This will avoid confusion between travelers at 
 the airport terminals about directions and gate numbers and it will also help tourists 
 at museums by providing them information about certain Art work. | [**business plan**][4]

<a style="color:indianred"><b> I'm looking for students to continue the development on this </b></a>

How many times do you come back from work and drop by the grocery store,

track of essential grocery items for you, and alerts you when you are under-stocked. | [**business plan**][5]

### Team 7: **Water Eye - Watermeter reader**
<a style="color:indianred"><b> I'm looking for students to continue the development on this </b></a>

Many dwellings have slow water leaks that remain undetected. 
The result can be damage to the structure and many gallons of water waste. 
Once a month, utility companies read the meter and charge the customers accordingly. 
However, most customers never view the meter and have no reliable means of tracking 
water usage in real-time.
 
To solve this, we made an add-on to the existing water meter that is both, 
accurate and economical. The solution reads the water meter digits using a 
repurposed mobile device and relays the information to the user's mobile device. 
The result is a product that can aid the user in tracking water consumption and 
detecting leaks in real-time. The device has the potential to save the user water 
and hard earned money. | [**business plan**][7] | [code][7code]

### Team 8: **Anti-theft tag**

Does misplacing your personal belongings worry you? 
Do you keep checking your pockets in a crowded place to make sure you still have your 
keys/wallet/phone? Worry no more. 
We design an anti-theft tag to prevent either the theft of personal belongings or 
their loss due to misplacement during travel or in crowded places. | [**business plan**][8]

### Team 9: **Never Forgotten - Baby buckle with alarm**

In the world of parents, nothing is more beloved than the safety of their children.
Families spend a lot of time in the car and that is why picking the 
right car seat is important which meets federal and ASTM Safety Standards. 
When one child dying is too much, an average of thirty-eight children 
die each year as a result of being left in the car and many more, 
near misses that are never reported on. Technology is finally at the point 
that an effort such as the Never Forgotten is actually very achievable. The 
Never Forgotten car seat will save the life of a child if used correctly. | [**business plan**][9]
