* Introduction - Design Needs and Desires  

    The need for the design work is explained and justified. 
    Typical questions to be addressed are:
    
  * Why is the work undertaken? What viewpoint do you assume for your 
design decision making?
  * Who will benefit from the resulting design? Who might be negatively affected?
  * What is the market for the proposed product? Do you have a vision of your customer?
  * Do laws or regulations affect the design space?  

* Design Attributes and Characteristics

    This section takes the needs and wants for the project and translates 
    them into actionable items. The following items must be included:
    
    * A short, concise design problem statement (one short paragraph)
    * A list of all design attributes with a short explanation for each one. 
    You must include at least one specific business attribute, such as price, cost, 
    investment cap, or return on investment. You must also include at least 
    one user-oriented attribute, i.e., a design attribute that would make users 
    select this design among other alternatives.
    * A matrix mapping attributes to measurable design characteristics that 
    the designers can address. Make a list of the characteristics explaining 
    each one, its relationship to attributes, and how it will be measured.
    * A list of objectives and requirements derived from the list of 
    characteristics that you will use to measure success of the design 
    developed during the project. Include target values for the requirements 
    and justify them.

> At completion of the project, these objectives and requirements 
will serve as a yardstick of successful completion of the design task. 
Objectives may have to be revised at a later time, when more information 
may be available. However, any later modification of objectives must be 
clearly justified. In setting the objectives one should always consider 
resources (what is needed to succeed), possible solutions (how well they may work), 
and the design to manufacturing transformation (what can be actually fabricated).

* Previous Designs

    Here you review previous designs to establish the present state of the art. 
    Patents, competing products, similar products for other markets should be discussed. 
    You need to know the state of the art to define the problem, and knowing about existing 
    designs gives you ideas for your own conceptual design. 
    As all the desired information may not be available to you at this time, 
    this section lists also any additional information needed and how it may be obtained. 
    
    A concluding paragraph should summarize the "design gap", namely, the need 
    for the proposed design work based on the preceding state of the art review 
    and the capabilities of the competition: what you set out to do is justified 
    because not only it is desirable but also because no one else has developed 
    a design solution, i.e., why is your design unique.
    
    A product positioning chart with two or three key attributes and associated 
    values should be included to illustrate the design gap and establish the 
    "market niche" for the intended product.

The length of this report should be about 5 pages plus appendices.
