# ANSYS DOE and Design Optimization Tutorial
by Max Yi Ren and Aditya Vipradas 

## Introduction

This is a step-by-step tutorial for the Design of Experiment (DOE) and Optimization tools in ANSYS. 
These tools allow you to better validate and understand your engineering model and further 
refine your design for specific properties of interest. Some technical details will be skipped. 
We use a running example on braking disc design developed by 
A. Durgude, A. Vipradas, S. Kishore, and S. Nimse in their MAE598 project (2016).

We encourage you to also read related chapters in 
the official [ANSYS Design Exploration User's Guide][ansys].

## What is DOE and optimization?
We first need to define some terminology for a design problem:

* **Parameters**: These include all "nobs" that tune your 
design (e.g., geometry, material, control gain, etc.)
* **Variables**: These are the subset of design parameters that you want to tune 
(so the rest of the parameters are fixed during the design). The set of all possible variable settings
is called the design space.
* **Objective(s)**: The objective measures how good the design variables are set. So this is 
usually some performance of the design (safety of a car, stability of a controller, etc.). In many cases,
we are interested in designing for more than one objective. In the following, we discuss the situation
of a single objective. We will then discuss how multiple objectives can be handled.
* **Constraints**: These are functions of the design variables that define a feasible variable space.
E.g., the design of a bridge has to have a maximum stress less than the critical stress (times a safety 
factor). 

*NOTE*: In ANSYS and some other software, the difference between **parameters** and **variables**
is not distinguished. So when you see "parameters", it might actually mean "variables".

**Optimization** is the iterative procedure for finding a design that maximizes/minimizes the objective by 
searching the design space. There are two major schools of optimization algorithms: gradient-based and 
gradient-free.

**DOE**: Many engineering design problems have objectives that are evaluated through expensive simulations/experiments.
For example, the design of car body structure (called "body in white") for safety criteria requires
high fidelity dynamics simulations to measure the acceleration curves on the manikin. This means that 
each function evaluation during the optimization takes a long time, and thus could making the 
optimization intractable. 

DOE is a set of methodologies that determine which design to evaluate from a potentially large design space,
so that we can create a statistical model to predict the objective values of other designs
with low uncertainty in prediction. Through the predictive model, we can also tell the sensitivity of variables,
i.e., whether the objective changes much with respect to each of the variables.

## Sample Problem Statement
To avoid being too mathematical, we introduce the following brake design problem as a running case.

Many engineering design problems involve more than one subsystems, while each subsystem has its own 
design goal. Achieving all goals simultaneously may not be feasible as trade-offs often exist. 
In this example, we have the following design goals (or called "objectives" in the optimization context):

* Design a brake disc for emergency braking conditions with minimal volume
* Minimize the maximum stress in the brake disc
* Maximize the first natural frequency of the brake disc
* Minimize the maximum temperature in the brake disc

### Description of the subsystems

* Structural Analysis (Swapnil Nimse): The brake disc has to sustain the pressure from the 
hydraulically actuated brake pads during sudden braking conditions. Stresses are induced 
due to friction between the brake pads and the disc. The disc also experiences centrifugal 
body forces due to its rotation. Resultant stresses generated due these forces can lead to
material failure. Therefore, it is of prime importance to make sure that the stresses in 
the disc are minimized. 

* Modal Analysis (Abhijeet Durgude): Free modal analysis is performed to ensure that the 
disc's first natural frequency is higher than the engine firing frequency. This guarantees 
that the disc does not experience failure due to resonance.

* Thermal Analysis (Sharan Kishore): Braking in a vehicle takes place due to friction 
between the brake pads and the rotor disc. This leads to heat flux generation in the disc 
which consequently results in increase in its temperature and thermal stresses. Emergency 
braking conditions induce high temperatures that damage the contact surfaces. It is therefore 
essential to minimize the temperature to prevent disc wear and tear.

The design optimization methodology flowchart is as shown in the figure.

## Design of Experiments
DOE is used to effectively sample a design space (e.g., all design parameters for the
 brake disc) so that a statistical model can be built to predict responses (e.g., 
 the maximum stress, or the first natural frequency, or the maximum temperature) of a given 
 design. DOE is useful when one can only sample a limited number of points (i.e., run a 
 limited number of simulations). The key idea of DOE is to ``spread out'' the samples 
 so that the resultant statistical model has low uncertainty in its model estimation 
 and thus high accuracy in prediction. 

%MAX: below, list the steps on where to click and use some snapshots 

* **Step 1: Define parameters and responses** To conduct DOE for a given model, we shall 
first define the list of design parameters and responses that we care about. To do so, ...

* **Step 2: Choose a DOE method** While ANSYS provides various DOE methods, we suggest 
**Latin Hypercube Sampling** (LHS) and **Optimal space filling** with user defined sample points. 
The main advantage of 
these methods is that the number of samples is independent from the number of parameters. Another 
(more advanced) choice is **sparse grid**, which only samples a few points initially and adaptively add
 new sample points based on the response surface. **Kriging with auto-refinement** has a similar effect.
Note, we do not recommend **Central Composite Design (CCD)** because in many cases, the objective cannot be 
approximated as a quadratic function, and CCD requires a large number of samples for relatively small
number of variables.

To proceed, click ... to perform a DOE.

Once done, you should see .... A list of sample points (combinations of parameter values) 
and corresponding response values can be found in .... 

* **Step 3: Create a response surface**
The DOE results can be used to create a response surface for prediction purpose. ANSYS 
provides the following list of response surface methods:

    * **Standard Response Surface**: This method uses a polynomial surface to fit the data. It requires
    the least amount of computation in both fitting and prediction. However, the performance of 
    the prediction largely depend on the choice of the polynomial bases. **Use this method when you have
    lots of data and the change in objective is smooth.**
    * **Kriging**: This method is non-parametric, meaning that the prediction will depend on all 
    existing data points. Thus the method could be slow in prediction when you have a large amount data to fit.
    It is also slow in fitting the data due to the calculation of pair-wise distances among data points.
    However, this method automatically fits through all data points. **Use this method when your data
    is highly nonlinear and limited, and you want your model to fit right through your data (i.e., you 
    trust your simulation results)**.
    * **Non-parametric Regression**: This method uses Support Vector Regression. It is similar to Kriging
    in that the prediction depends on current data. But instead of using all data, this method chooses the
    most important data points to perform prediction. Thus its computation cost for prediction is less than
    that of Kriging. Yet, its cost of fitting is still high. The model does not fit through the data. 
    **Use this method when your data is highly nonlinear, and you don't need your model to fit right
     through your data.** 
    * **Neural Network**: Feedforward neural network creates a nonlinear mapping from the input (a design) to the 
    output (its objective value) that mimics the expensive simulation. It is slow in training (and may
    end up with a different model each time you train, even if the data is the same) when the network is
    deep, but the prediction only involves simple matrix calculation and is fast. 
    **Use this method when your data is highly nonlinear but you have lots of them, and you don't need
    your model to fit right through your data**.
    * **Sparse Grid**: This method goes with the corresponding DOE method. It is similar to Kriging in
    that it handles highly non-linear objectives. It does so by adaptively sampling in the most uncertain
    areas of the design space, and thus may reduce the number of samples needed. **Use this method when 
    the objective is highly nonlinear and you cannot afford many simulations**
    

To demonstrate, we fit our dataset with a 2^{nd}-order polynomial model. 
One can visualize the the resultant model in .... For models with more than 2 input 
parameters, .... One can also check the goodness of fit of the response surface model by .... 
For example, the goodness of fit plots for the structural analysis of the brake disc is shown below.

**Hint**: There are two approaches to improve the goodness of fit: (1) increase the sample size 
in DOE; and (2) increase the "complexity" of the response surface. To perform the latter, one can 
choose a high-order polynomial model or a non-parametric model such as **Kriging**. 

The common practice for building response surface models is the following: First, look at the 
visualization of the DOE data and see if a polynomial function can reasonably explain the data. 
For example, the data in the following figure is smooth and can be approximated by .... 
In such cases, choose to use a polynomial model. Otherwise, use Kriging.

**Caution**: While increasing the "complexity" can work well, it is not recommended to use this 
method to push the goodness of fit to the limit. This is because when doing so, we may very 
likely **overfit** the model, so that it actually have worse **prediction** performance than a 
model with less fit. Indeed, according to Occam's Razor, an ideal response surface model should 
have both low training error (high goodness of fit) and low complexity. The intuition of this is 
that the best explanation of a phenomenon is the simplest and effective one.

* Step 4: Sensitivity analysis
% MAX: any idea?

## Optimization
<!--Optimization is about tuning the design parameters iteratively until the maximum (-->
<!--or minimum) of the response(s) of interest -->
<!--are reached. An optimization problem requires three elements: The {\it objective(s)} are -->
<!--the responses to be maximized (or minimized); the {\it variables} are the design parameters -->
<!--that the objective is sensitive to; the {\it constraints} are the responses that need to -->
<!--be within certain bounds. In ANSYS, these elements can be set up in ***.  -->

### Single-objective vs. Multi-objective
There is rarely a design case where we only want to optimize a single response. 
In the running example, a set of objectives are listed. However, finding a Utopian design 
that simultaneously optimizes all objectives is unachievable in reality. This is because 
for a reasonable problem setting, there always exist conflicts among objectives. 
There are two solutions to this: (1) One can set one of the objectives as the objective in 
ANSYS, and the rest as constraints. By changing the constraints, one can derive a sequence 
of optimal solutions. This set of solutions is call **Pareto Optimal**, and a surface spanned 
in the space of objectives fitting through these solutions is call the **Pareto frontier**. 
For cases with two (three) objectives, it is called the **Pareto curve** (**Pareto surface**). 
Deriving the Pareto frontier is often more valuable than obtaining a single optimal solution, 
since the former reveals quantitatively how conflicting objectives trade off for the design 
problem of interest.
% need a figure here.

### Optimization algorithms
ANSYS provides a list of optimization algorithms:

* **Screening**: Randomly sampling the space and pick out the good ones. 
Use this as an initial trial to make sure everything is setup correctly, e.g., does your simulation
give reasonable results? 
* **Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA)**: Simultaneously find Pareto-optimal designs. You can use this 
when you have multiple objectives. Not the only choice though, see discussion above. 
* **Nonlinear Programming by Quadratic Lagrangian (NLPQL)**: Fast local search. Use this when (1) there is
only one objective (but you can set other objectives as constraints), (2) the simulation does not take
too long (in minutes), (3) the number of variables is small (less than 10).

### An example on structural optimization
<!--For the subsystem 1 optimization problem, the upper bound on the stress constraint -->
<!--is parametrized and the corresponding optimal volume is evaluated using the -->
<!--\emph{Interior-Point Method (IPM)} in MATLAB. A Pareto curve of optimal volume against the -->
<!--respective stress upper bound is plotted using the IPM and MOGA algorithms as shown -->
<!--in Figure \ref{fig2}. All the MATLAB codes are attached in Appendix B. As observed from -->
<!--the figure, the curves obtained using both the algorithms are in good agreement with -->
<!--each other. Using the Pareto curve, one can easily obtain the optimal volume -->
<!--value for a given stress upper bound constraint. -->
