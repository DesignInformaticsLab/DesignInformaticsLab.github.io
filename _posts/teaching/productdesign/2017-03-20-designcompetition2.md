## Problem Statement
Design a bridge using the following criteria:

* **Dimensions**: The bridge needs to be at least 50 feet (15.24 meters) long and at least 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide.

* **Material**: The material needs to be structural steel everywhere, with Young's modulus 200Gpa and Poisson's ratio 0.3.

* **Functionality**: The bridge needs to be fully paved with the same material. 
The pavement needs to be **flat** with a width of at least 7 feet (2.1 meters). See examples below.

* **Boundary conditions**: The two ends of the bridge are fixed in all directions to 
the flat ground. A downward point load of 2500 lbf (11121 N) is applied to the center of the pavement of the bridge. See figure below.

* **Design constraint**: The total mass of the bridge needs to be below 2000 Pound (907 Kg). 

* **Design objective**: The maximum deflection of the bridge needs to be as small as possible.

## Submission
Please submit the final design in ANSYS format (the .agdb file should contain the geometry and the simulation) 
along with **all necessary files** in a **zip** to yiren@asu.edu with the file name
"yourlastnameTeamNumber.zip", e.g., "renTeam0.zip". 

In the email, please also report the 
**maximum deflection** value and the **total mass** value. 
The total mass value can be found under the geometry tab in the ANSYS MODEL. 

Make sure that the reported numbers are consistent with your model.
