# Design Methodology Overview
by Max Yi Ren

## Activity 1: Introduce the problems your want to address
As we have started thinking about real-world problems that could be addressed in this project, 
it is a good time to share our ideas and collect feedback from others.

For the team who presents the problem and potential solutions, please provide the following information

* What is the problem?
* How is it done today?
* What's new in your solution?
* Who cares?
* What are the risks of your solution?

Also see [The Heilmeier Catechism][2].

For other teams, please criticize from the following perspectives:

* Did the proposer miss existing solutions?
* Do people really care about this problem?
* Who will pay for the solution?
* What are the risks of this solution?

Also watch Tony Fadell's TED talk: [*The first secret of great design*][1]

## Activity 2: Create a persona
A **Persona** is a description of a character that the product will be designed for. 
A Persona represents:

* **Personal Profile**, e.g., age, gender, education, habits, social status, marital status, occupation, hobbies, et.
* **Role**, e.g., position at work, role at work, etc.
* **Context**, e.g., social and cultural background, peers, family status

What is the persona of your users?

## Activity 3: Think out of the box
1. Double check your assumptions: You have nine dots. Draw **four** continuous straight lines passing through each of the nine dots, but DO NOT pass
                                                      a dot twice, retrace a line, or lift your pen.

2. Let's try another problem: You are one of five people in a locked room with a concrete 
floor. There is a steel tube embedded in the floor. A ping-pong ball is inside the tube. 
Get the ball out of the tube in the most efficient manner.

You have:
* a chisel
* a box of cornflakes
* a hammer
* a file
* a wire coat hanger
* a light bulb
* 100ft of clothesline
 
3. Team brainstorming: 

* List potential solutions to your problems
* Discuss what assumptions you imposed on the solutions
* Discuss if these assumptions can be removed

## Activity 4: Morphological analysis

Now let's think about how your solution can be realized through a product. 
Practice the following using your problems

1. Identify all functions of your solution
2. Make each function a row in a matrix
3. Identify all possible means to realize each function, and list in columns
4. Create solutions by combining different means and drawing the concept

## Activity 5: Optimal design and optimal control

* Learn the concept of **objective**, **attribute**, **variable**, **constraint** in a static setting
* Learn the concept of **state**, **action**, **reward**, **controller** in a dynamic setting
* Is finding solutions to a static design problem a dynamic process?
* Team discussion: What are your design objectives, variables, attributes, constraints, and assumptions?

## Activity 6: Critical thinking

1. Design a cola can
2. Find the curve of fastest descent (see [Brachistochrone curve][5] and [its derivation][7])
3. Design a bridge (see [TopOpt][4])
4. Four-bar linkage design (see [MotionGen][3])
5. Optimal design + control (see [ecoRacer game][6])
