# Analytical Design and Homework 3
by Max Yi Ren

See the [lecture notes][1] and the [Ansys tutorial][2].

## Activity 1: DOE and response surface methods
Based on the structural analysis settings in the Ansys tutorial, conduct DOE and create a response
surface. Discuss which DOE method and response surface model you should use.


## Homework 3: Design Analysis
Create the necessary simulation for your project, and perform optimization on 
your product attributes with respect to the design variables. Note: If your project
does not involve physical design, please use the braking disk example in the tutorial.

The report should contain the following elements:

1. An executive summary of your model, the objectives, 
constraints, variables, and design results (One page).

2. A description of your geometry, material assignment, mesh settings, and boundary conditions.

3. A discussion on whether your simulation results are reasonable.
 
4. A description of the analysis: DOE, response surface, sensitivity analysis
    * How do you choose your DOE method?
    * How do you choose your response surface model?
    * How good is your response surface model?
    * Are your objectives sensitive to the chosen variables?

5. A description of the optimization and results
    * What optimization algorithm do you use?
    * What improvements do you get from the optimization?
    * Is your optimal solution reasonable?
    
Notes:

* Please do not paste a large amount of images directly from ANSYS. You need to edit
figures so that they contain just the necessary information.

* Submit your report to yiren@asu.edu with the exact title "MAE540 Homework 3 - Team number". 
Please make sure it is in **pdf** format.
