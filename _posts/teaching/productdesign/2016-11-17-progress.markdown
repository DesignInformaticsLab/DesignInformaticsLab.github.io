The progress report document is an evolved version of your proposal. 
The original proposal material should be used as much as possible with 
editing that reflects new information. The final report itself will be a 
further evolved version of your progress report. With some early planning you 
can substantially reduce the time required for report preparation.

The report should include the following main sections. 

1.      Introduction

2.      Previous Designs

3.      Design Objectives

4.      Concept Generation and Selection

    *      Alternative Concepts

    *      Concept Selection Process

    *      Current Design Concept

    *      Description of the Beta prototype

5.      Engineering Functionality Analysis

6.      Economic Analysis

7.      Time Schedule

Include discussion of remaining work and plan

You can rearrange/rename things as it makes sense to you but you must 
include all the pertinent information.
