## Progress Report (Mar. 28th)

The progress report document is an evolved version of your proposal. 
The original proposal material should be used as much as possible with 
editing that reflects new information. The final report itself will be a 
further evolved version of your progress report. With some early planning you 
can substantially reduce the time required for report preparation.

The report should include the following main sections. 

1.      Introduction (same as preliminary)

2.      Review of the current state-of-the-art solutions (same as preliminary)

3.      Design Objectives (same as preliminary)

4.      Concept Generation and Selection: Describe all concepts you have 
proposed/investigated and your concept selection process. Provide details of your 
current design concept. Describe your Beta prototype. Images and video links 
to the demonstration of a working prototype are encouraged.

5.      Summary of the market analysis (based on Homework 2).
5.      Engineering Functionality Analysis: Summarize the engineering challenges and 
your analysis (based on Homework 3).

6.      Time Schedule: Summarize all issues to be addressed and what action items 
will be taken.

You can rearrange/rename things as it makes sense to you but you must 
include all the pertinent information.
