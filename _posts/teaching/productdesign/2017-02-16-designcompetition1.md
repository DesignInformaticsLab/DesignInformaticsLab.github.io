# Design Competition 1 - Spring 2017
by Max Yi Ren

## Problem Statement
The Food And Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
predicted that 
*9.6 billion people ... are going to inhabit the planet by 2050: 
food production must increase by 70% by 2050, and this has to be achieved in spite of 
the limited availability of arable lands, the increasing need for fresh water 
(agriculture consumes 70 per cent of the world's fresh water supply) and other less 
predictable factors, such as the impact of climate change ...* (Federico Guerrini, 
"The Future Of Agriculture? Smart Farming", Forbes). This trend projection, 
while [being questioned due its assumptions][1], has motivated 
numerous industries to look for a new paradigm of farming. 

Here we focus on the particular challenge of livestock and poultry management. 
Tracking and monitoring individual 
cows over a large area is difficult, especially in developing countries
where vehicles cost a significant amount and infrastructure (e.g., road 
and electricity
coverage) is limited. Raising poultry in a conventional way involves a lot of effort that 
could be saved with smarter tools (see [this Indonesian farmer explaining his needs][2]).
New solutions to these problems have started to emerge in recent years,
with the advance of IoT and data analytics. 

As an engineering design team, please draft a proposal for a product that 
could improve the management of livestock or poultry. Your proposal should include the followings:

* A description of your problem: Focus on a country/environment that you are familiar with,
and describe one particular problem in that environment, e.g., livestock
tracking with no internet access, prevention from theft, identifying diseased chicken from
a large population, etc. Provide evidence that this problem does exist.

* A description of your solution: Provide a review of existing solutions (this does not
need to be thorough). Explain your solution and **illustrate it with sketches**. Skectches
should be self-explanatory. Explain potential technical, social, political challenges 
in implementing this solution, and possible measures to address them.

* A description of your user and buyer: Explain who will be using this product, and who
will pay for it. Describe potential product attributes that the user/buyer cares about.

* A one-sentence pitch of your product.
