# Design Competition 1 - Spring 2017
by Max Yi Ren

## Background
The Food And Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
predicted that food production must increase by 70% by 2050 for 9.6 billion people. 
While such trend projection requires further [scrutiny][1], it is clear that 
food production, safety, and wasting issues deserve more attention, 
and have indeed attracted numerous industries to invest in shaping
 a new paradigm of farming. 

## Problem Statement 1
A particular challenge is the management of livestock and poultry.
Tracking and monitoring individual 
cows over a large area is difficult, especially in developing countries
where vehicles cost a significant amount and infrastructure (e.g., road 
and electricity coverage) is limited. Raising poultry in a conventional way involves human labor that 
could be saved with smarter tools (see [this Indonesian farmer explaining his needs][2]).
New solutions to these problems have started to emerge in recent years,
with the advance of IoT and data analytics. 

As an engineering design team, please draft a proposal for a product that 
could improve the management of livestock or poultry. Your proposal should include the followings:

* A description of your problem: Focus on a country/environment that you are familiar with,
and describe one particular problem in that environment, e.g., livestock
tracking with no internet access, prevention from theft, identifying diseased chicken from
a large population, etc. Provide evidence that this problem does exist.

* A description of your solution: Provide a review of existing solutions (this does not
need to be thorough). Explain your solution and **illustrate it with sketches**. Skectches
should be self-explanatory. Explain potential technical, social, political challenges 
in implementing this solution, and possible measures to address them.

* A description of your user and buyer: Explain who will be using this product, and who
will pay for it. Describe potential product attributes that the user/buyer cares about.

* A one-sentence pitch of your product.

## Problem Statement 2
In US, one out of every six people lives in a food-insecure household, while we as a society waste approximately one third of 
all food. See [this video][3] for example. Food wasting happens both before and after they reach 
consumers, due to various reasons including appearance concerns (consumable but less appealing food 
are discarded by farmers and grocery stores) and our busy life style or lack of social awareness.

As a design team, please draft a proposal for a product or service that 
could help to reduce food wasting, reuse wasted food, or improve the distribution of food.
Your proposal should include the followings:

* A description of your problem: Focus on one specific problem, e.g., 
smart food storage, consumption tracking, food sharing, etc. 
Provide a context where this problem exists.

* A description of your solution: Provide a review of existing solutions (this does not
need to be thorough). Explain your solution and **illustrate it with sketches**. Skectches
should be self-explanatory. Explain potential technical, social, political challenges 
in implementing this solution, and possible measures to address them.

* A description of your user and buyer: Explain who will be using this product, and who
will pay for it. Describe potential product attributes that the user/buyer cares about.

* A one-sentence pitch of your product.
