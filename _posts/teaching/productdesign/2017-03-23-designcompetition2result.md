# Design Competition 2 Results - Spring 2017


## Summary
Here are some statistics. 36% of the submissions are on time (before 6:40pm), 52% of 
all are feasible, i.e., within the mass limit (25000 Kg). Among all feasible designs, the 
minimal max deformation achieved is 5.79e-6 Meter (updated Apr. 19, 2017), with mass 17939 Kg.

The average grade is 79.7, with std 8.4. Highest grade is 100. 

## Grading rules
Let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be the maximal and minimal max deformation values for all designs that are 
submitted in time, and $d$ be your value. The grade is
 $$20\left(1-\frac{d-d_2}{d_1-d_2}\right)+80$$.
 
The penalty for late submission is 10 points. The penalty for violating the mass constraint
is 5, 10, 20 points for mass within 4 times of the limit, within 10 times of the limit, and beyond.
I also adjust your grades manually to make the competition "fair". For example, if you have 
a huge mass and thus the lowest deformation, then according to the above formula, you might still
get a good score because your deformation value is so much better than that of the best 
feasible design.

Regarding the concern that delaying the submission may lead to better grade, the average grade
for in-time submissions is 87.1, while that for late submissions is 75.4. 96% (33%) of in-time 
(late) submissions have grades above 80.
