# Preference learning and Homework 2
by Max Yi Ren

See the [lecture notes][1] and the [discrete choice analysis tutorial][2].

## Activity 1: Test the survey
Please participate in a mock [survey][3] regarding your preference on cars. Once we collect the data,
we will go through a data analysis procedure called **discrete choice analysis**, from where
quantified preference on attribute levels can be revealed for the participant group as a whole and
for individual participants. 

## Homework 2: Conduct a market survey and report your analysis results

The report should contain the following elements:

1. A description of your survey goal, i.e., what do you want to learn from your consumer group? This
could include qualitative goals, and quantitative hypotheses.

2. A description of design attributes and attribute levels

3. A complete sample survey and a discussion on how questions are designed

4. A description of how data is collected
    * Who do you collect data from?
    * When is the data collected?
    * Are your collected data valid? How do you validate?

5. A description of how the data is analyzed
    * What preprocess steps are necessary for your data?
    * For discrete choice analysis, how do you set up your model and what assumptions do you use?
    * What results do you get from your analysis?
    * What insights do you get from your analysis?
    * From these insights, how will you improve your survey?
    * **Please provide a visualization of your results**. Simply pasting MATLAB tables to your report will not be accepted.

6. The code and raw data you used for the analysis
    * Make sure that by directly running your code with your data, others can reproduce your results.

Notes:
* Submit your report to yiren@asu.edu with the exact title "MAE540 Homework 2 - Team number". 
Please make sure it is in **pdf** format.
