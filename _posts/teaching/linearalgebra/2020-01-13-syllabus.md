### Homework assignments
Homework assignments will NOT be graded and do not count towards your final grade. However, 
homework problems may appear in the exams. 

### Exams
Closed book, no calculator, focused on theory. If a student cannot attend the exam, the instructor must be notified 
prior to the exam with a valid excuse at least one day before the exam. 
The exam will be re-taken off the class (difficulty level may vary).

***

### Quiz
Quizzes will take place in some of the classes and be graded. The overall grade for quiz will be the average 
over the best 70% of all your quiz grades.  

***
### Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is mandatory, and any form of plagiarism will not be tolerated. Please see ASU's Student Academic 
Integrity Policy for details. Per the policy, all academic integrity violations must be reported to the Dean of 
Academic & Student Affairs. The first violation results in a punishment affecting the current class (zero for the 
homework/project, reduction of a letter grade, E or XE for the class, depending on the severity of the violation); 
second violation might result in an expulsion from ASU. 

**What is considered academic integrity violation/cheating/plagiarism in this class?**

* Any form of collaboration, talking or discussing the problems during the exams and quizzes.
