### Material Strength and Stiffness

This is a list of concepts that you need to remember. All from Chapter 2 of Shigley's.

* Stress $$\sigma$$: load on unit surface
* Strain $$\epsilon$$: normalized deformation
* Elastic: zero deformation after removal of loads
* Linear elasticity: $$\sigma = E\epsilon$$, where $$E$$ is the Young's modulus (or modulus of elasticity)
* Plastic: permanent deformation even after removal of loads
* Yield strength
* Ultimate (tensile) strength
* Fracture strength
* Shear modulus (modulus or rigidity)
* Modulus of resilience
* Hardness
