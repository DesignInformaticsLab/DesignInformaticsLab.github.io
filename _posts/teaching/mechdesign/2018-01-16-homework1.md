2. Please name your submission **exactly** "MEE342 HW1".
3. If you used Word, please convert it to PDF.
4. If you have codes, please put them in the same PDF file rather than sending the codes or a zip.
5. This homework is **DUE on Jan 31**.

### Problem 1 (10 Points)

For the plane stress <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_x"> = -8MPa, 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_y"> = 7MPa, 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\tau_{xy}"> = 6MPa cw, 
    draw a Mohr's circle diagram properly labeled,
   find the principal normal and shear stresses, and determine the angle from the $$x$$ axis to 
   $$\sigma_1$$. Draw stress elements as in Fig. 3-11c and d (Shigley's) and label all details.


### Problem 2 (40 Points)

A countershaft carrying two V-belt pulleys is shown in the figure. Pulley A receives power from a
   motor through a belt with the belt tensions shown. The power is transmitted through the shaft and
   delivered to the belt on pulley B. Assume the belt tension on the loose side at B is 15 percent of
   the tension on the tight side.
   
   * Determine the tensions in the belt on pulley B, assuming the shaft is running at a constant
   speed.
   
   * Find the magnitudes of the bearing reaction forces, assuming the bearings act as simple
   supports.
   
   * Draw shear-force and bending-moment diagrams for the shaft. If needed, make one set for the
   horizontal plane and another set for the vertical plane.
   
   * At the point of maximum bending moment, determine the bending stress and the torsional
   shear stress.
   
   * At the point of maximum bending moment, determine the principal stresses and the maximum
   shear stress.

### Problem 4 (30 Points)

The cantilevered bar in the figure is made from a ductile material and is statically loaded with
   <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F_y = 200"> lbf and 
   <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F_x = F_z = 0">. Analyze the stress situation in rod AB by obtaining the following
   information.
   
   * Determine the precise location of the critical stress element.
   
   * Sketch the critical stress element and determine magnitudes and directions for all stresses acting
   on it. (Transverse shear may only be neglected if you can justify this decision.)
   
   * For the critical stress element, determine the principal stresses and the maximum shear stress.

### Problem 5 (20 Points)

Consider a cantilever beam as shown in the figure with length 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l"> and the left end fixed to a wall.

1. Derive the deflection <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y">  of the beam along 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> under a single downward force 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F"> on the right,
and assume that the moment of inertia <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I">  is constant along 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x"> . 
(Show complete derivation instead of the final function 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y(x)">) 

2. Now consider that the beam has two connected parts, with the part on the left (of length 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=l/2">) having a moment of 
inertia 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_1">, 
and the part on the right 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_2">. 
Derive the deflection <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=y"> again.
 Ignore stress concentration.

3. Further, consider that the cross-sections for the two parts are both circular, and the total volume
of the beam is constant. What should 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_1"> and 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=I_2"> be for the beam to have minimal maximum deflection?

4. Can you extend your conclusion in 3 to a beam with three evenly segmented parts with different moment of inertia?
