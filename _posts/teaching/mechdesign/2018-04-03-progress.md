# Progress and Final Report Requirements

The **final** report should have details on the followings

1. Description of the vehicle: This include all raw and processed data of the vehicle you 
plan to design for, the free body diagram and the dynamics model for acceleration (Problem 1), 
or the energy consumption model for Problem 2.

2. The description and code that you used for the system level design, where you determine the target
gear ratio(s) based on the model you built in (1). Please include all assumptions 
you make during the modeling and design. Also include validation attempts (e.g., comparison of 
your results with real test data of the vehicle).

3. The description and code for the detailed gearbox design, where you determine 
the sizes and material selections for the shafts, gears, bearings, and keys to meet 
the target gear ratio(s) while minimizing the gearbox volume. 
Please include all assumptions you make during the design process.

4. A **short video** (less than 3 minutes) where you explain your system level design, i.e., 
why is your choice of the gear ratio a good one?

## What is expected at Progress Report?

You should have (1) ready, with all details on the data, their sources, and the post-processes. 
You should have the majority of (2) done, with evidence that your code is working properly 
or you have identified the issues and have a good plan to address them. For part (3), 
you can describe the design flow, i.e., how you plan to connect the element-wise designs covered in
class together.

## Documentation and submission

There are two ways to document your project: a single PDF file or a single Markdown file. 
You can submit a zip file with all your codes and spreadsheets if they are documented well. 
If you like what you did in the project, I recommend that you post it somewhere online. 

## FAQ

* I don't know where to start from.

The project has two stages: 1) find the target gear ratio(s), 2) design the gearbox for these ratios.
See the following answers for 1). For 2), please follow Chapter 18 and homework.

* How to determine the gear ratio for Problem 1?

Here are the steps: 

1. Derive the differential equation for vehicle speed. The function should 
look like $$\dot{v} = f(v)$$, where $$\dot{v}$$ is the acceleration, and $$f(v)$$ is the total force,
which includes the tractive force (contributed from the engine torque) and the friction forces 
(contributed by rolling resistance and drag). **Note 1**: the tractive force is linearly related to 
the gear ratio to be determined. **Note 2**: the engine torque is a function of engine speed 
(rev per second), and thus a function of the vehicle speed.

2. Use MATLAB to solve the differential equation, with the initial condition $$v(0)=0$$. 
The solution will be a velocity-time curve from where we can find the time cost for accelerating
to 60 mph. **Note**: There are two cases where one would need to switch to the second gear. 
The first is when switching gear increases the output torque at the wheel; the second is when
the first gear cannot reach 60 mph. In either cases, one should be able to determine when 
and where to switch gear. When gear switching is needed, one would need to solve 2 ODEs. The 
second one should use the terminal point of the first one (the time and the velocity) as 
the initial condition.

3. With 1 and 2, one can now perform trial and error to find the optimal ratios that minimize
the total time.

* How to relate engine rpm to vehicle speed?

Note that the engine is connected to the transmission, which is connected to the final drive, 
which is connected to the wheel, all through shafts. Therefore, there is a linear relation 
between the engine and the vehicle speed.

* Shall we make the shafts inline?

This is up to you.

* My simulated car runs too fast. What's wrong?

Normally from solving the differential equation, you will found that your car runs faster
its real performance number. This is largely because we do not consider energy/torque loss in the 
system.
