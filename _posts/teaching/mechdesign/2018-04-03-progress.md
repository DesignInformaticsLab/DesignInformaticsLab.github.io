# Progress and Final Report Requirements

The **final** report should have details on the followings

1. Description of the vehicle: This include all raw and processed data of the vehicle you 
plan to design for, the free body diagram and the dynamics model for acceleration (Problem 1), 
or the energy consumption model for Problem 2.

2. The description and code that you used for the system level design, where you determine the target
gear ratio(s) based on the model you built in (1). Please include all assumptions 
you make during the modeling and design. Also include validation attempts (e.g., comparison of 
your results with real test data of the vehicle).

3. The description and code for the detailed gearbox design, where you determine 
the sizes and material selections for the shafts, gears, bearings, and keys to meet 
the target gear ratio(s) while minimizing the gearbox volume. 
Please include all assumptions you make during the design process.

4. A **short video** (less than 3 minutes) where you explain your system level design, i.e., 
why is your choice of the gear ratio a good one?

## What is expected at Progress Report?

You should have (1) ready, with all details on the data, their sources, and the post-processes. 
You should have the majority of (2) done, with evidence that your code is working properly 
or you have identified the issues and have a good plan to address them. For part (3), 
you can describe the design flow, i.e., how you plan to connect the element-wise designs covered in
class together.

## Documentation and submission

There are two ways to document your project: a single PDF file or a single Markdown file. 
You can submit a zip file with all your codes and spreadsheets if they are documented well. 
If you like what you did in the project, I recommend that you post it somewhere online.
