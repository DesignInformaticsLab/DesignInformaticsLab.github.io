### Problem 1 (10 Points)

Two steels are being considered for manufacture of as-forged connecting rods subjected to 
bending loads. One is AISI 4340 Cr-Mo-Ni steel capable of being heat-treated to a tensile 
strength of 260 ksi. The other is a plain carbon steel AISI 1040 with a ultimate strength of 
113 ksi. Each rod is to have a size giving an equivalent diameter of 0.75 in. Determine the 
endurance limit for each material. Is there any advantage to using the alloy steel for this 
fatigue application?

### Problem 2 (20 Points)

A 1-in-diameter solid round bar has a groove 0.1-in deep with a 0.1-in radius machined into it.
 The bar is made of AISI 1020 CD steel and is subjected to a purely reversing torque of 1800 
 lb-in. For the S-N diagram of this material, let f=0.9.
 
* Estimate the number of cycles to failure.

* If the bar is also placed in an environment with a temperature of 750 F, estimate the 
number of cycles to failure.

### Problem 3 (20 Points)
The cold-drawn AISI 1040 steel bar shown in the figure is subjected to an axial load 
fluctuating between 0kN and 28kN. Estimate the fatigue factor of safety based on achieving 
infinite life using modified Goodman criterion and the yielding factor of safety. 
If infinite life is not predicted, estimate the number of cycles to failure.

### Problem 4 (50 Points)
Choose one of the following two problems.

1. "Chopsticks" (see figure below) is introduced to facilitate the landing of SpaceX BFRs. 
To design the chopsticks concept, let us simplify it as a 2D truss structure and consider the rocket as a point load 
(similar to what we did in the design competition).
    * (40 Points) Derive an optimal truss design that minimizes the compliance while satisfying a total weight constraint.
    * (10 Points) For the design you created, comment on its yield, fatigue, and buckling risks.

    This [truss optimization code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/102Bu4ZGRkomLlhbVwEtHPjyIJEPSGE_e#scrollTo=ZNYHR-rbkv5a) may come in handy.
