# Powertrain Data

The following MATLAB codes define the engine, motor, and battery used in an earlier version of Prius. 
You will only need the engine data code for problem 1. For problem 2, you will need all data for powertrain
components. The entire power management code can be found [here](\_teaching\mechdesign\ECMS_MEE342.zip).
Please be cautious about the units!

## Engine data

This function does two things. First, it takes in the engine speed (```Weng```, rad/s) and 
engine torque (```Teng```, Nm), and outputs the fuel consumption 
(gram per second). Second, it computes the max torque (```Tlimit```) for a given engine speed (```Weng```).
