### Problem 1 (10 Points)

A ductile hot-rolled steel bar has a minimum yield strength in tension and compression of 350 MPa.
Using the distortion-energy and maximum-shear-stress theories determine the factors of safety
for the following principal stresses:

* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_A = 100 MPa, \sigma_B = 100 MPa">
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_A = 100 MPa, \sigma_B = -100 MPa">
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_A = -50 MPa, \sigma_B = -100 MPa">

### Problem 2 (10 Points)

A ductile material has the properties 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S_{yt}=60ksi, S_{yc}=75ksi">
Using the ductile Coulomb-Mohr theory, determine the factor of safety for the states of stress given below:

* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_x = 25 kpsi, \sigma_y = 15 kpsi">
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_x = -12 kpsi, \sigma_y = 15 kpsi, \tau_{xy} = -9 kpsi">

### Problem 3 (10 Points)

A brittle material has the properties 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S_{ut} = 30 kpsi, S_{uc} = 90 kpsi">. 
Using the brittle Coulomb-Mohr and modified-Mohr theories, 
determine the factor of safety for the following states of
plane stress.

* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_x = -15 kpsi, \sigma_y = 10 kpsi, \tau_{xy} = -15 kpsi">
* <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_x = 15 kpsi, \sigma_y = -15 kpsi">


### Problem 4 (20 Points)

Determine the actual factor of safety for yielding for problem 2 from 
[HW1](/mechdesign_homework/2018/01/16/homework1.html). 
Use the distortion-energy theory. The material is 1018 CD steel.

### Problem 5 (30 Points)

The figure shows a shaft mounted in bearings at A and D and having pulleys at B and C. The
forces shown acting on the pulley surfaces represent the belt tensions. The shaft is to be made of
AISI 1035 CD steel. Using distortion-energy theory with a design factor of 2, determine the
minimum shaft diameter to avoid yielding.

### Problem 6 (30 Points)

Prepare the following materials for your team presentation.

1. (15 Points) A presentation that covers key concepts for others to understand the workflow of your analysis and design code.
    * For **Shaft** teams: The presentation should cover (1) a summary of fatigue analysis with sample problems, 
    (2) an overview of the shaft design process, i.e., the determination of shaft dimensions based on its connected 
    components and design requirements (e.g., safety factors for fatigue, yielding, and deflection failure modes), 
    (3) a summary of critical points on a shaft, and (4) an introduction to your code with a sample use case.
    
    * For **Gear** teams: The presentation should cover 
    (1) an introduction to spur gear (nomenclature, key parameters and their relationships, geometric constraints, force analysis),
    (2) an overview of the gear design process, i.e., the determination of gear ratio, geometric parameters, and gear materials based on 
    design requirements (e.g., safety factors for wear and yielding failure modes), and (3) an introduction to your code with a sample use case.
    
    * For **Key/Bearing** teams: The presentation should cover 
    (1) an introduction to key and bearing (nomenclature, parameters, and existing catalog), 
    (2) an overview of the key and the bearing design process, and 
    (3) an introduction to your code with sample use cases.
    
2. (15 Points) A repo on GitHub that contains the following:
    * A main code that executes the component-wise analysis and design functions.
    * A readme file that explains the expected inputs and outputs of the code.
    * Note that the code can be written in any language of your choice. 
    Please convert it to Matlab and Python using chatGPT and upload these versions for the convenience of other users.
