# Finite Element Analysis in Python

In this note we go through the creation of a simple Python code that (1) defines element-wise stiffness matrix, 
(2) assembles the global stiffness matrix, and (3) solves the resulting system of equations by incorporating 
boundary and loading conditions.

## Environment

TLDR: Use [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).

There are two approaches to setting up your coding environment and get things going. 

The easiest way is to use an online editor such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).
In Colab, click *File-New notebook* at the top left corner. Now you can start coding and also collaborate! 
The drawbacks of this approach are that (1) debugging is trickier (see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52656692/debugging-in-google-colab)), 
(2) you have limited memory and CPU (since it is free!), (3) packages have to be installed on the fly, and obviously (4)
you need to be online. 
But if you just started using Python, (1-3) are not your immediate concerns. 

If you plan to work offline, then you will need to install a few things locally.

(1) **Language**: Please use [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Not Python 2 because syntax are different). 
For Windows users, I recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) instead of the native Python since it comes with
numerical computing packages (e.g., Numpy and sciPy) that you may encounter issues when installing on Windows.
 
(2) **Development Environment**: I recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) 
and [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Both are free for students. 
Within the environment, you can code, test, and collaborate with others. 
It also allows you to manage Python packages more easily.

(3) **Version Control (Optional)**: To collaborate with other people, you will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/), 
which manages your files (e.g., compare differences between versions or restore to a previous version), 
and [Github](https://github.com/), which allows you to share your locally managed files with other people, 
so that you can simultaneous work on the same file and sync through github.

## A Running Example

We use the following truss as a running example (see figure below). Here we have 4 nodes and 4 truss members (edges). 
We treat each truss member as an element. Each node has two degree of freedom, i.e., displacement in x and y directions.
So the total degree of freedom without considering boundary conditions is 8, 
which are labeled as $q_1$ to $q_8$ in the figure. With the boundary conditions, $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_4$, $q_7$, and $q_8$
are fixed. Loadings are applied at $q_3$ and $q_6$.

## A Truss Class
Here we define a class for a truss. We start with an initialization function that records 
the following parameters that define the truss: 
(1) nodes - the elements of this list are x- 
and y-coordinates of the nodes that define truss members; 
(2) edges - the elements of this list 
are pairs of node indices. Each pair defines a truss member; 
(3) fixed_dofs - this list specifies which degrees of freedom are fixed;
(4) loads - this list specifies where loads are applied
(5) E - Young's modulus, assumed to be constant across the truss
(6) A - cross section area, assumed to be constant across the truss 

```python
    def __init__(self, nodes, edges, fixed_dofs, loads, E, A):
        """
        :param nodes: A list of nodes with their coordinates in 2D
        :param edges: Node connections: (0,2) node 0 and 2 are connected
        :param fixed_dofs: A list of node constraints: (0,2,4) dof # 0, 2, 4 are fixed
        :param loads: A list of point loads at nodes: (0,1000,0) dof # 1 has a point force of 1000
        :param E: Young's modulus
        :param A: Cross section area
        """
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.E = E
        self.A = A
        self.edges = edges
        self.fixed_dofs = fixed_dofs
        self.loads = loads
        self.num_nodes = len(nodes)
        self.dof = 2 * self.num_nodes

        self.l = []
        self.theta = []
        self.k = []
        self.dof_id = []
        self.K = np.zeros((self.dof, self.dof))
```

For the running example, we use the following to create a truss. Notice that Python indexing starts with 0. 
So $q_1$ corresponds to the 0th element rather than the 1st.

```python
    nodes = np.array([[0., 0.], [40., 0.], [40., 30.], [0., 30.]])
    edges = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 2], [2, 3]])
    fixed_dofs = np.array([0, 1, 3, 6, 7])
    loads = np.array([0, 0, 20000, 0, 0, -25000, 0, 0])
    E = 29.5e6
    A = 1
    truss = Truss(nodes, edges, fixed_dofs, loads, E, A)
```

## Element-wise Stiffness Matrix

Now we add a function to the truss class that computes the element-wise stiffness matrix based on 
(1) the orientation, 
(2) the cross section area,
(3) the Young's modulus,
and (4) the length of the truss member. 

```python
    # compute the element-wise stiffness matrix
    def k_matrix(self, theta, A, E, l):
        """
        :param theta: Orientation of the truss member
        :param A: Area of the truss member
        :param E: Young's modulus of the truss member
        :param l: Length of the truss member
        :return: Stiffness matrix
        """
        c = np.cos(theta)
        s = np.sin(theta)
        return np.array([[c**2, c*s, -c**2, -c*s],
                         [c*s, s**2, -c*s, -s**2],
                         [-c**2, -c*s, c**2, c*s],
                         [-c*s, -s**2, c*s, s**2]])*A*E/l
```

## Global Stiffness Matrix

Now we assemble the global stiffness matrix. To do so, we iterate over all truss members (edges). 
For each member, we compute its length (`l`) and orientation (`theta`), which then allows us to compute 
its element-wise stiffness by calling `self.k_matrix(theta, self.A, self.E, l)`. 
Lastly, we add the element-wise stiffness matrix to the global one. 
The positioning of the element-wise matrix in the global one depends on the dof indices of that particular element 
(which are `[e[0] * 2, e[0] * 2 + 1, e[1] * 2, e[1] * 2 + 1]`).

```python
    # assemble global stiffness matrix
    def compute_stiffness(self):
        for e in self.edges:
            v = self.nodes[e[1]] - self.nodes[e[0]]
            l = np.linalg.norm(v)
            theta = np.arctan2(v[1], v[0])
            self.l.append(l)
            self.theta.append(theta)
            self.k.append(self.k_matrix(theta, self.A, self.E, l))
            self.dof_id.append([e[0] * 2, e[0] * 2 + 1, e[1] * 2, e[1] * 2 + 1])
            self.K[np.ix_(self.dof_id[-1], self.dof_id[-1])] += self.k[-1]

```

## Solve the FEA problem

We now define one last function for the truss class to solve the FEA problem. 
In this function, we first call `self.compute_stiffness()` to prepare the global stiffness matrix. 
Then we use the boundary conditions to find the sub matrix 
corresponding to the actual degrees of freedom of the structure ($q_3$, $q_5$, $q_6$ in the running example). 
Lastly, we solve the resulting linear system of equation to find the displacement of the actual degrees of freedom.


```python
    def solve(self):
        self.compute_stiffness()
        K = np.delete(np.delete(self.K, fixed_dofs, 0), fixed_dofs, 1)
        loads = np.delete(self.loads, fixed_dofs)
        return np.linalg.solve(K, loads)
```
