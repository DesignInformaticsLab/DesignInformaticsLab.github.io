### Problem 1 (15 Points)

Consider a shaft loaded in torsion and bending with M_a = 50Nm, T_a = 35Nm, M_m = 55Nm and
T_m = 25Nm. We choose shaft material to have S_ut = 800MPa and S_y = 580MPa, and a 
fully corrected endurance limit of S_e = 220MPa. K_f = 2.4 and K_fs = 2.0. 
Determine the minimum acceptable diameter of the shaft based on modified-Goodman for a design factor of 1.5.

### Problem 2 (25 Points)
The rotating solid steel shaft is simply supported by bearings at points B and C and is driven
by a gear (not shown) which meshes with the spur gear at D, which has a 150-mm pitch diameter.
The force F from the drive gear acts at a pressure angle of 20 degree. The shaft transmits a torque
to point A of $$T_A$$ = 340 Nm. The shaft is machined from steel with $$S_y$$ = 420 MPa and
$$S_{ut}$$ = 560 MPa. Using a factor of safety of 2.5, determine the minimum allowable diameter of
the 140-mm section of the shaft based on (a) a static yield analysis using the distortion energy
theory and (b) a fatigue-failure analysis. Assume sharp fillet radii at the bearing shoulders for
estimating stress-concentration factors.

### Problem 3 (25 Points)
The shaft shown below has been proposed for the application defined in problem 3-73.
Specify a square key for gear B (i.e., determine the width/height ( w = h ) and length l of the
key), using a factor of safety of 1.1. It is known from problem 3-73 that a steady torque of
3101Nm is transmitted through the key from the gear to the shaft. Use 1020 CD steel for
the key. All fillets 2mm. Dimensions in mm.

### Problem 2 (25 Points)
The shaft shown in the figure is driven by a gear at the right keyway, drives a fan at the left keyway,
and is supported by two deep-groove ball bearings. The shaft is made from AISI 1020 cold-drawn steel. 
At steady-state speed, the gear transmits a radial load of 230 lbf and a tangential load of
633 lbf at a pitch diameter of 7 in.
(a) Determine fatigue factors of safety at any potentially critical locations.
(b) Check that deflections satisfy the suggested minimums for bearings and gears.

### Problem 5 (10 Points)
Please read the wind turbine gearbox design problem [here](/_teaching/mechdesign/gearbox.pdf).
The spreadsheet for solving this problem is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dfkUJD38Czb83s4KqrjdQ_XKyZaOYaEAMyOnBMsjDPY/edit?usp=sharing).
**Please make a copy of it so you can edit.**
Try to find gear teeth numbers (on the summary page, highlighted in yellow) that are feasible (check gear feasibility in the "constraint" column)
and produce the minimal gearbox volume.

Report the numbers, and please describe your strategy in searching for these numbers.

### Problem 3 (10 Points)

A 17-tooth spur pinion has a diametral pitch of 8 teeth/in, runs at 1120rpm, and drives a
gear at a speed of 544rpm. Find the number of teeth on the gear and the theoretical
center-to-center distance.

### Problem 4 (10 Points)
For a spur gearset with phi = 20 deg, while avoiding interference, find: the smallest pinion tooth
count at a ratio m = N_G/N_P = 2.5, and the largest gear tooth count possible with this pinion.

### Problem 5 (20 Points)
A commercial enclosed gear drive consists of a 20 deg spur pinion having 16 teeth driving
a 48-tooth gear. The pinion speed is 300rev/min, the face width 2in, and the diametral pitch
6 teeth/in. The gears are grade 1 steel, through-hardened at 200 Brinell, made to No. 6
quality standards, uncrowned, and are to be accurately and rigidly mounted. Assume a pinion
life of $$10^8$$ cycles and a reliability of 0.90. Determine the AGMA bending and contact stresses
and the corresponding factors of safety if 5hp is to be transmitted.

### Problem 6 (20 Points)
A 57-tooth spur gear is in mesh with a 23-tooth pinion. It is known that phi = 20 deg. 
The gearset transmits 125hp at 1000rpm pinion speed. Size the spur gears for a bending failure safety
factor of at least 2 assuming a steady torque, full-depth teeth, Q_v = 9, an AISI 4140 steel
pinion (S_t = 40ksi), and a class 40 cast iron gear (S_t = 13ksi). 
The desired reliability is 99.9%
with a life of 10^5. Take K_o = 1, (Y_N)_P = 3.517N^{-0.0817} 
and (Y_N)_G = 6.1514N^{-0.1192}.
