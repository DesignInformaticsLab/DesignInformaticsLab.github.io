### Instructions

1. This homework is **DUE on Mar 26**.
2. **Please submit this homework in class**.

### Problem 1 (15 Points)

Consider a shaft loaded in torsion and bending with $$M_a$$ = 50Nm, $$T_a$$ = 35Nm, $$M_m$$ = 55Nm and
$$T_m$$ = 25Nm. We choose shaft material to have $$S_{ut}$$ = 800MPa and $$S_y$$ = 580MPa, and a 
fully corrected endurance limit of $$S_e$$ = 220MPa. $$K_f$$ = 2.4 and $$K_fs$$ = 2.0. 
Determine the minimum acceptable diameter of the shaft based on modified-Goodman for a design factor of 1.5.
<!--7-1-->

### Problem 2 (25 Points)
The rotating solid steel shaft is simply supported by bearings at points B and C and is driven
by a gear (not shown) which meshes with the spur gear at D, which has a 150-mm pitch diameter.
The force F from the drive gear acts at a pressure angle of 20 degree. The shaft transmits a torque
to point A of $$T_A$$ = 340 Nm. The shaft is machined from steel with $$S_y$$ = 420 MPa and
$$S_{ut}$$ = 560 MPa. Using a factor of safety of 2.5, determine the minimum allowable diameter of
the 250-mm section of the shaft based on (a) a static yield analysis using the distortion energy
theory and (b) a fatigue-failure analysis. Assume sharp fillet radii at the bearing shoulders for
estimating stress-concentration factors.

### Problem 3 (25 Points)
The shaft shown below has been proposed for the application defined in problem 3-73.
Specify a square key for gear B (i.e., determine the width/height ( w = h ) and length l of the
key), using a factor of safety of 1.1. It is known from problem 3-73 that a steady torque of
3101Nm is transmitted through the key from the gear to the shaft. Use 1020 CD steel for
the key. All fillets 2mm. Dimensions in mm.

### Problem 4 (25 Points)
The shaft shown in the figure is driven by a gear at the right keyway, drives a fan at the left keyway,
and is supported by two deep-groove ball bearings. The shaft is made from AISI 1020 cold-drawn steel. 
At steady-state speed, the gear transmits a radial load of 230 lbf and a tangential load of
633 lbf at a pitch diameter of 7 in.
(a) Determine fatigue factors of safety at any potentially critical locations.
(b) Check that deflections satisfy the suggested minimums for bearings and gears.

### Problem 5 (10 Points)
Please read the wind turbine gearbox design problem [here](/_teaching/mechdesign/gearbox.pdf).
The spreadsheet for solving this problem is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dfkUJD38Czb83s4KqrjdQ_XKyZaOYaEAMyOnBMsjDPY/edit?usp=sharing).
Try to find gear teeth numbers (on the summary page, highlighted in yellow) that are feasible (check gear feasibility in the "constraint" column)
and produce the minimal gearbox volume.

Report the numbers, and please describe your strategy in searching for these numbers.
