### Problem 1 (10 Points)

A steel rotating-beam test specimen has an ultimate strength of 120 ksi. 
Estimate the life of the specimen if it tested at a fully reserved stress amplitude of 70 ksi.

### Problem 2 (10 Points)

Two steels are being considered for manufacture of as-forged connecting rods subjected to 
bending loads. One is AISI 4340 Cr-Mo-Ni steel capable of being heat-treated to a tensile 
strength of 260 ksi. The other is a plain carbon steel AISI 1040 with a ultimate strength of 
113 ksi. Each rod is to have a size giving an equivalent diameter of 0.75 in. Determine the 
endurance limit for each material. Is there any advantage to using the alloy steel for this 
fatigue application?

### Problem 3 (20 Points)

A 1-in-diameter solid round bar has a groove 0.1-in deep with a 0.1-in radius machined into it.
 The bar is made of AISI 1020 CD steel and is subjected to a purely reversing torque of 1800 
 lb-in. For the S-N diagram of this material, let f=0.9.
 
* Estimate the number of cycles to failure.

* If the bar is also placed in an environment with a temperature of 750 F, estimate the 
number of cycles to failure.

### Problem 4 (20 Points)

A rectangular bar is cut from an AISI 1020 cold-drawn steel flat. The bar is 2.5 in 
wide by 3/8 in thick and has a 0.5-in diameter hole drilled through the center. 
The bar is concentrically loaded in push-pull fatigue by axial forces F, 
uniformly distributed across the width. Using a design factor of 2, 
estimate the largest force F that can be applied (ignore buckling).

### Problem 5 (20 Points)
A solid round bar with diameter of 2 in has a groove cut to a diameter of 1.8in, 
with a radius of 0.1in. The bar is not rotating. The bar is loaded with a repeated 
bending load that causes the bending moment to fluctuate between 0 and 25000lb-in. 
The bar is hot-rolled AISI 1095, but the groove has been machined. Determine the 
factor of safety for fatigue based on infinite life using the modified Goodman criterion, 
and the factor of safety for yielding.

### Problem 6 (20 Points)
The cold-drawn AISI 1040 steel bar shown in the figure is subjected to an axial load 
fluctuating between 0kN and 28kN. Estimate the fatigue factor of safety based on achieving 
infinite life using modified Goodman criterion and the yielding factor of safety. 
If infinite life is not predicted, estimate the number of cycles to failure.
