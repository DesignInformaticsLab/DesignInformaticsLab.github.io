### Problem 1

A ductile hot-rolled steel bar has a minimum yield strength in tension and compression of 350 MPa.
Using the distortion-energy and maximum-shear-stress theories determine the factors of safety
for the following principal stresses:

* $\sigma_A = 100 MPa$, $\sigma_B = 100 MPa$
* $\sigma_A = 100 MPa$, $\sigma_B = -100 MPa$
* $\sigma_A = -50 MPa$, $\sigma_B = -100 MPa$

### Problem 2

A ductile material has the properties 
$S_{yt}=60ksi$, $S_{yc}=75ksi$ Using the ductile Coulomb-Mohr theory, 
determine the factor of safety for the states of stress given below:

* $\sigma_x = 25 kpsi$, $\sigma_y = 15 kpsi$
* $\sigma_x = -12 kpsi$, $\sigma_y = 15 kpsi$, $\tau_{xy} = -9 kpsi$

### Problem 3

A brittle material has the properties $S_{ut} = 30 kpsi$, $S_{uc} = 90 kpsi$. 
Using the brittle Coulomb-Mohr and modified-Mohr theories, 
determine the factor of safety for the following states of
plane stress.

* $\sigma_x = -15 kpsi$, $\sigma_y = 10 kpsi$, $\tau_{xy} = -15 kpsi$
* $\sigma_x = 15 kpsi$, $\sigma_y = -15 kpsi$


### Problem 4 

Determine the actual factor of safety for yielding for problem 2 from 
[HW1](/mechdesign_homework/2018/01/16/homework1.html). 
Use the distortion-energy theory. The material is 1018 CD steel.

### Problem 5

The figure shows a shaft mounted in bearings at A and D and having pulleys at B and C. The
forces shown acting on the pulley surfaces represent the belt tensions. The shaft is to be made of
AISI 1035 CD steel. Using distortion-energy theory with a design factor of 2, determine the
minimum shaft diameter to avoid yielding.
